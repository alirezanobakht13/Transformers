# Transformers

A simple implementation of transformers.

## How to use

You can download `my_transformers.py` and import its module into your code. In order to understand how it works, look at `Tutorial.ipynb`. make sure you have torch (the versions in `requirements.txt`) installed.

## Contribution

Any issues or pull requests aimed at improving the implementation, or providing better explanations in comments, descriptions, and tutorials, are welcome.
